Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and
released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation
Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses.
As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its
Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. Meanwhile, others have developed alternative implementations
of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries),
and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets).
